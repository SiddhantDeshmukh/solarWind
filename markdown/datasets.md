# Datasets

## Introduction

To accurately predict solar wind parameters, it is imperative to use
datasets that contain precise measurements and a cadence high enough to
capture both short and long-term trends. In this study, we make use of
the OMNI COHO dataset with hourly cadence \citep{cdaweb_omnicoho1hr}. This
dataset is formulated in the radial-tangential-normal (RTN) coordinate
system, meaning spatial correlations which would otherwise would be present
are eliminated, leaving only temporal correlations
\citep{owens_riley_2017}.
