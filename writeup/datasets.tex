\section{Datasets}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{subsec:datasets_intro}

To accurately predict solar wind parameters, it is imperative to use
datasets that contain precise measurements and a cadence high enough to
capture both short and long-term trends. In this study, we make use of
the OMNI COHO dataset with hourly cadence \citep{cdaweb_omnicoho1hr}.
This dataset is formulated in the radial-tangential-normal (RTN)
coordinate system, meaning spatial correlations which would otherwise
would be present are eliminated, leaving only temporal correlations
\citep{owens_riley_2017}. In this study, we focus on radial magnetic field
strength (B$_r$) and radial wind velocity (v$_r$).

\subsection{Solar cycles}
\label{subsec:solar_cycles}

In order to ensure our training, validation and testing datasets contain
similar information for predictions to be accurate, we slice the data by
solar cycle. Cycles 21 - 22 are used in the training dataset, cycle 23 is
used for validation, and cycle 24 is used for testing. Table
\ref{table:cycle_checks} shows the number of points in each cycle, the
date ranges of these cycles, and how many NaN points are in each.

% Would be good to make a histogram here to see how points are distributed
% in time: Are they random or are they in specific times in solar cycles?
