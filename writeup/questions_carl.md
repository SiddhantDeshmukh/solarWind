# Questions for Carl (Meeting 04/02/2021)

- Can we use the current train / val / test split of solar cycles (21, 23),
  22 and 24, respectively?
- Predicting 1 point vs predicting 24?
- Is our Analogue Ensemble written effectively? One (clear) improvement is
  to parallelise the code.
- How can we effectively compare the LSTM to the Analogue Ensemble?
- What is your opinion on the similarity of solar cycles for prediction?
  Can we take even fewer points as a training set to still have effective
  predictions?
- Do you think our network architecture makes sense for the problem at
  hand?
- What physics are we missing / neglecting from the model?
