\section{Analogue Ensemble}
\label{sec:an_en}

We employ the use of an analogue ensemble (AnEn) \cite{owens_an_en},
\cite{haines_an_en} as a baseline metric to measure our LSTM against. Given
a recent observation of $n$ points, the AnEn forecasts the next $m$ points.
It involves looking at previous observations to find similar ones to the
recent observation. A number of analogues $k$ is selected with a certain
loss metric - we use mean squared error (MSE) loss to find the analogues
that best fit the recent observation.

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i = \hat{Y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

The time for a single prediction depends on the size of the dataset the
AnEn can use for analogues.
